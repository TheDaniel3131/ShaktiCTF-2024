it took me awhile to solve these but I just use reverse image search and then look up the history of the ship

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Celeste

questions:
1)Who is the individual from crew has previously sailed with the captain of the ship?
2)What was the name of Captain's close friend from the crew that found the abandoned ship?
3)In the logbook, the captain noted the sighting of land, describing it as an island.What is the name of this enigmatic island?
4)What was the original name of the ship shown in the image?

I tried many attempts because of the naming lol but I got it at the end :)
